									<h3>William Hogan BSc - Software Engineering</h3>
									<p></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/AboutMeImage.webp" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>Hi, my name is William Hogan. I'm a software engineer with a passion for building user focused applications. 
									I love problem solving and working on complex challenges either within a team environment or, on my own initiative.
								    Currently I am working on a project that analyses data to improve network performance and visualise usage trends. 
								    I have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, while also designing and building user friendly interfaces.
									<br />
								    Through my academic work, I have developed expertise in programming languages such as Java, SQL, MySQL, JavaScript, PHP and Python.
								    I have also become proficient in software testing (TDD and ATDD) using Junit and RobotFramework.
								    I am particularly interested in data-driven applications, data-analytics and I'm excited to learn new technologies.
								   <br></br>
								    When I'm not working on projects, I can be found hiking, reading about latest technologies or, travelling to somewhere new.
								</p>

								<p><h3>Experience</h3></p>
								<p><h4>Jan 2024 - Aug 2024</h4>
									<i><u>LM Ericsson - Internship</u></i>
									<br />
								    <p>During my internship, with LM Ericsson, I was extremely fortunate to be part of a welcoming and supportive team. 
								    The skills I developed while there have been instrumental in helping me progress both technically and as a person. 
								    I worked predominantly on testing but also on a platform related project which automated the configuration of a server remotely.

									My time working in Ericsson was a great confidence boost and removed any negative thoughts i may have had in my ability to performance
									in this Industry. I had the pleasure of working with a team that treated me as equal from the first day, and also asked for my opinion
									at times.
									</p>
								    <p><h4>Jan 2014 - Oct 2021.</h4>
									<i><u>ASA Properties - Carpenter</u></i>
									<p>
									While working with ASA Properties, I gained invaluable experience managing projects and teams to deliver quality
									products in an efficient and timely manner within tight deadlines. One of my responsibilities was continuous process reviews,
									and improvements, to ensure smooth production and provide other skilled trades to complete their work with minimal obstruction.
									This also provided me with planning and organisational skills while enabling me to view projects over the long term and identify 
									any issues that may arise.

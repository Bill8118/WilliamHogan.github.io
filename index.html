									<h3>William Hogan BSc - Software Engineering</h3>
									<p></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/AboutMeImage.webp" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>Hi, my name is William. I am a software engineer with a passion for building user focused applications. 
									I love problem solving and working on complex challenges either within a team environment or, on my own initiative.
								    Currently I am working on a project that analyses data to improve network performance and visualise usage trends. 
								    I have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, while also designing and building user friendly interfaces.
									<br />
								    Through my academic work, I have developed expertise in programming languages such as Java, SQL, MySQL, JavaScript, PHP and Python.
								    I have also become proficient in software testing (TDD and ATDD) using Junit and RobotFramework.
								    I am particularly interested in data-driven applications, data-analytics and I'm excited to learn new technologies and techniques.
								   <br></br>
								    When I'm not working on projects, I can be found hiking, reading about latest technologies or, travelling to somewhere new.
								</p>
								<p><h3>Education</h3></p>
								<p><h4>Sep 2022 - May 2025</h4></p>
								<i><u>TUS Athlone</u></i>
									<p>During my studies at TUS Athlone, I made some great friends that I will always remember, including the Lecturers
									who were a great support and helped me throughtout the course. 
									Some of the modules I took over the four years were:
									<br />
									<ul><b>modules</b>
									<li>Databases</li>
									<li>Software Development</li>
									<li>Connected Devices</li>
									<li>Mathematics</li>
									<li>Mobile Apps</li>
									<li>Management and Organisational Behaviour</li>
									<li>Networks</li>
									<li>Machine Learning</li>
									<li>Security</li>
									<li>Web Development</li>
									<br />
									The knowledge I have attained from TUS Athlone has provided me with a solid platform to build on and I am excited 
									to meet new people in the workplace that I can collaborate with and learn from, while sharing my own knowledge.
									</ul>
									<p><h4>Jan 2022 - July 2022</h4></p>
									<i><u>OCA (Oracle Certified Associate - Java)</u></i>
									<br />
									During this online course, with ecollege.ie, I completed the OCA. This course provided me with solid foundations of Java
									and I would highly recommend it as a beginner course for anyone thinking of a career in software development. It
									covered all the basic concepts of programming from different data types through Lists, loops, nested loops, classes,
									methods, exception handling, JDBC and more.
									<br />

								<p><h3>Experience</h3></p>
								<p><h4>Jan 2024 - Aug 2024</h4>
									<i><u>LM Ericsson - Internship</u></i>
									<br />
								    <p>During my internship, with LM Ericsson, I was extremely fortunate to be part of a welcoming and supportive team. 
								    The skills I developed while there have been instrumental in helping me progress both technically and as a person. 
								    I worked predominantly on testing but also on a platform related project which automated the configuration of a server remotely.
									<br />
									My time working in Ericsson was a great confidence boost and removed any negative thoughts i may have had in my ability to succeed
									in this Industry. I had the pleasure of working with a team that treated me as equal from the first day, and also asked for my opinion
									at times. I was provided the opportunity to collaborate with offshore teams, on one of the projects I was assigned, and enjoyed developing
									a respectful and successful working relationship to achieve our goals on time.
									</p>
								    <p><h4>Jan 2014 - Oct 2021.</h4>
									<i><u>ASA Properties - Carpenter</u></i>
									<p>
									While working with ASA Properties, I gained invaluable experience managing projects and teams to deliver quality
									products in an efficient and timely manner within tight deadlines. One of my responsibilities was continuous process reviews,
									and improvements, to ensure smooth production and provide other skilled trades to complete their work with minimal obstruction.
									This also provided me with planning and organisational skills while enabling me to view projects over the long term and identify 
									any issues that may arise.
